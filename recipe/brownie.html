    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

       <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips or chunks (optional)</li>
        <li>Optional add-ins: chopped nuts, caramel swirls, or extra chocolate chips for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat and Prepare</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease or line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on two sides for easy removal.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Melt the Butter</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a microwave-safe bowl or on the stove, melt the butter until fully liquefied. Allow it to cool slightly.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mix Wet Ingredients</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the melted butter and granulated sugar until well combined.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add eggs and Vanilla</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Incorporate Dry Ingredients</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sift in the cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add chocolate Chips</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If desired, fold in the chocolate chips or chunks for an extra chocolatey experience and added texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Transfer to Pan</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly using a spatula.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be cautious not to overbake, as the goal is to achieve a fudgy texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cool and Cut</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once baked, remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool in the pan on a wire rack. Once completely cool, use the parchment paper overhang to lift the brownies out of the pan. Place them on a cutting board and cut into squares or desired shapes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Classic Fudge Brownies are now ready to be enjoyed! Serve them as is or with a scoop of ice cream for an extra indulgence.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
